Very happy to announce that [coffee-coverage](https://github.com/benbria/coffee-coverage) now
has support for Istanbul.  Lots of good
[tutorials](https://github.com/benbria/coffee-coverage#tutorials) available to hopefully get you
up and running as fast as possible.  Give it a try, and let me know if you have any questions
or problems or comments.
