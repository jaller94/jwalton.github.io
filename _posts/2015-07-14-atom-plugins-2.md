With Atom 1.0 out, a revised list of handy plugins I've found for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/).

* **[mpeterson2/save-session](https://github.com/mpeterson2/save-session)** - Remember unsaved buffers when you kill and restart Atom - an essential feature if you're coming from Sublime.
* **[chemoish/atom-valign](https://github.com/chemoish/atom-valign)** - ctrl-\ to vertically align assignments.
You can configure the hotkey in keymap.cson:

        '.editor':
            'ctrl-cmd-a': 'vertical-align:align.

* **[thomaslindstrom/color-picker](https://github.com/thomaslindstrom/color-picker)**
  - shift-cmd-c to edit HTML colors.
* **[AtomLinter/linter-coffeelint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-coffeelint)** -
  Highlight problems in coffee-script.  Add a coffeelint.json file to your project to change settings.
* **[burntime/atom-monokai](https://github.com/burntime/atom-monokai)** - The monokai color theme (should be familiar if you're a [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) user.)
