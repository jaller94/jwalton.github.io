<p>I am really psyched about the new <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jonthecollector/entry/our_collectors">G1 Garbage Collector</a>.  That link is worth a read if you want to learn about it.  This is a really a pretty revolutionary re-think of the way garbage is collected in the JVM, and should bring substantial improvements to applications with large heaps that need low pause times.</p>
