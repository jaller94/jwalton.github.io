There's lots of various writeups out there on how to do this, but this one is mine.  In this article, we're going to explore setting up Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi, and tunnel all our DNS queries to CIRA's "Canadian Shield" DNS service using `cloudflared`.  Since I'm using CIRA as my DNS provider, I thought I'd also set this up in an official CIRA Raspberry Pi case:

## Conventions

Throughout this article, we're going to use 192.168.0.10 for the IP address of the Pi-hole server, and 192.168.0.1 for the IP address of the router.  If these aren't what you want to use, you'll have to update these appropriately.

## Install Ubuntu

First thing we need to do is install an OS on our Raspberry Pi.  I grabbed a copy of the [64-Bit Ubuntu Image](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) for my Raspberry Pi 3 B+.  There's detailed instructions for how to [flash the SD here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#2-prepare-the-sd-card).

Then, plug a keyboard, monitor, and network cable into the Raspberry Pi and boot it up.  It can take a while to boot, but once it does you should see a "ubuntu login" prompt.  You need to wait quite a bit longer yet, and eventually you'll see a messaging saying "cloud-init" and some other stuff, and then you can either login directly using "ubuntu" as the username and password, or you can SSH in if you can figure out the IP address.

(If it's taking an obnoxiously long time for Ubuntu to create the ubuntu user, I'll note that the first time I tried this, I used an old 8GB microSD card I found in the bottom of a drawer.  Turns out it was a old class 4 card, which is slooooow.  Upgrading to a modern microSD card made everything more pleasant.)

## Static IP

We're going to want to set a static IP for the Raspberry Pi.  You can do this a couple of ways, but we're goint to do it on our router.  In the DHCP section, you can set a static IP for a device if you know it's MAC address.  On your Pi, run `ip link` and you should get some output like this:

```sh
$ ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether b8:27:eb:00:00:01 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether b8:27:eb:00:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

The MAC address is the bit next to "link/ether" under `eth0`, so in our case "b8:27:eb:00:00:01".  We can assign a static IP to this from the router.

Now we want to force the Pi to renew it's DHCP lease.  Note that this is going to change the IP of the Pi, so once you do this you'll get booted out and have to login again:

```sh
sudo dhclient -r && sleep 5 && sudo dhclient
```

## Set Hostname and Upgrade

Run these commands to set our hostname:

```sh
# Create a user for us to use other than `ubuntu`
sudo adduser jason
sudo usermod -aG sudo jason
echo "jason ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers

# Set our hostname
sudo hostname pihole
echo pihole | sudo tee /etc/hostname

# Upgrade Ubuntu (this can take a LONG while...)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

The upgrade can take a really long time.  So long, it's likely you may drop your SSH sesssion for one reason or another.  If this happens, you can check to see if the upgrade is still happening with:

```sh
watch "ps -ef | grep apt | grep -v grep"
```

This will list all the processes with "apt" in the name and refresh it every 2 seconds.  If you see `apt upgrade` running, then the upgrade is still going.

## Docker

For a long time I ran `cloudflared` and Pi-hole using Docker.  This works well, so long as you're not running any other docker containers, but you can run into some challenges if you want [other docker containers](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/issues/230) on the same host to use Pi-hole to lookup DNS entries.  You end up having to run cloudflared using `--network host`, because otherwise you can't easily configure what IP Pi-hole should connect to, and then you run Pi-hole as `--network host`, but then you run into problems with other docker containers that are not running as `--network host` being unable to connect to Pi-hole to resolve domain names.

But, if you want to install docker:

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

And then go look at [these instructions](https://github.com/jwalton/jwalton-docker-pihole).

## Install cloudflared

`cloudflared` is a service that will accept DNS requests on port 5053, and forward then to a service provider of our choosing over HTTPS!  If you're in Canada, I recommend CIRA's excellent Candian Shield DNS service (although unfortunately their DoH endpoint's certificate doesn't list their [IP address as an alt-name](https://twitter.com/JasonCWalton/status/1319315399104733185), so we're going to have to add an entry to our /etc/hosts file to get this working).

```sh
# If you're using CIRA's Canadian Shield, you need to
# add protected.canadianshield.cira.ca to your /etc/hosts.
# If you're not using Canadian Sheild, you can skip this.
# If you're not using "protected", then replace that with
# whatever you are using, and fix the IP addresses.  See
# https://www.cira.ca/cybersecurity-services/canadian-shield/configure.
echo "149.112.121.20 protected.canadianshield.cira.ca" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "149.112.122.20 protected.canadianshield.cira.ca" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# Note this gets the arm64 version - if you're running
# a 32 bit version of Ubuntu, this won't work.
wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/download/2020.10.2/cloudflared-linux-arm64
chmod 755 ./cloudflared-linux-arm64
sudo mv ./cloudflared-linux-arm64 /usr/local/sbin/cloudflared
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/sbin/cloudflared

# Make sure this works!
cloudflared --version

# Create a config file for cloudflared.  If you don't want to use CIRA's
# Candian Shield DNS service, you can use Cloudflare's DNS instead
# by replacing the proxy-dns-upstream with https://1.1.1.1/dns-query.
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloudflared
echo "proxy-dns: true
proxy-dns-port: 5053
proxy-dns-upstream:
 - https://protected.canadianshield.cira.ca/dns-query
" | sudo tee /etc/cloudflared/config.yml

# Add cloudflared as a service
sudo cloudflared service install --legacy
sudo systemctl start cloudflared
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

# Make sure it works
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5053 duckduckgo.com
```

## log2ram (optional)

Pi-hole writes a lot of logs to disk.  Since we're running on a Raspberry Pi with a micro SD card, we can slowly over time wear out the limited write capacity of the card.  This is probably not a huge concern, but we can lighten the load on the SD card here with a package called "[log2ram](https://github.com/azlux/log2ram)", which baically mounts /var/log on a ramdisk.  The upside to this is less wear on your SD card.  The downside is you'll lose your logs when the system reboots.  To install:

```sh
echo "deb http://packages.azlux.fr/debian/ buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azlux.list
wget -qO - https://azlux.fr/repo.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install log2ram

# If you want to edit the size of the RAM disk:
sudo vi /etc/log2ram.conf

sudo reboot
```

After your Pi reboots, you can check that it's working with:

```sh
$ mount
...
log2ram on /var/log type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=40960k,mode=755)
...
```

## Install Pi-hole

Installing Pi-hole is quite painless:

```sh
# Install pi-hole
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

Mostly you can answer the defaults during the installation process.  When it asks you for your upstream DNS provider, use "127.0.0.1#5053" (which is the cloudflared instance).

When you're done, be sure to take note of the admin password so you can
login to the web admin.  If you don't, it's ok, you can always reset it by running `pihole -a -p`.

When the install is done, visit [http://192.168.0.10/admin](http://192.168.0.10/admin) (replace 192.168.0.10 with the IP of your Pi-hole), and login.

The first thing we want to configure on our new Pi-hole is ad lists.  Vist "Group Management =&gt; Adlists".  Check out [The Firebog's Big Blocklist Collection](https://firebog.net/) for a list of blocklists to add.  After adding some lists, go to "Tools =&gt; Update Gravity" and click the big "Update" button.

If you have any websites that Pi-hole is blocking that you need to access (maybe you work in web development, so you actually want to visit a tracking site to see statistics) then head over to the "Whitelist" and add any domains you need.

One last thing; visit the "Settings" page, open the DNS tab, and make sure the "Upstream DNS Servers" are set to only use 127.0.0.1#5053.

Finally, test it out:

```sh
# Should succeed
dig @localhost duckduckgo.com
# Should get 0.0.0.0 as the address
dig @localhost mobile.pipe.aria.microsoft.com
```

## Setup Router

Now that we have Pi-hole installed, we need to make sure devices on our network are using it.  There's instructions [here](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-configure-my-devices-to-use-pi-hole-as-their-dns-server/245) for configuring your router.  There's lots of different routers out there, and it's easy to misconfigure this, so when you're done, go to [https://dnsleaktest.com/](https://dnsleaktest.com/), and make sure DNS is being resolved by the DNS servers you think it should be, and only by those servers.  (If you're using CIRA's Canadian Shield, and you're in the eastern part of Canada, this will probably be `cira-tsi.tor2.teksavvy.com`).

### FreshTomato

Since all routers are different, it's hard to give exact instructions on how to set up your router.  But *my( router is running [FreshTomato](http://freshtomato.org/), so if you're using a Tomato-based router, then you can follow along with this.

Go to "Advanced =&gt; DHCP/DNS", and then in the "Dnsmasq Custom configuration", add this (replace 192.168.0.10 with the IP of your Pi-hole):

```
dhcp-option=option:dns-server,192.168.0.10
dhcp-option=option6:dns-server
```

This will tell any clients on your network to use 192.168.0.10 (the Pi-hole) for DNS queries over IPv4, and not to try to do DNS queries over IPv6.  Why no IPv6?  Because likely if you're on residential internet, your ISP will assign you a new IPv6 prefix every time you reboot your modem, so it's hard to give the Pi-hole a static IPv6 address.  It's not impossible, but it's not easy, and IPv6 lookups will still work over IPv4, so you're not losing much here.

If you have [a guest wifi network](https://learntomato.flashrouters.com/setup-guest-network-guest-wifi-tomato-vlan/) set up, you're going to run into a problem - clients on your 192.168.0.x network can see the Pi-hole fine, but clients on your guest network won't be able to (this is the whole idea behind a guest network, afterall - to make it so guests can't get to machines on your private network).

I've seen a variety of interesting solutions to this, including setting up the Pi-hole's Wifi interface to be on the guest network.  I don't like my house guests, so I'm going to just let them see ads.  :P  If our guest network is setup on br1, we'll modify the above to be:

```
dhcp-option=option:dns-server,192.168.0.10
dhcp-option=option6:dns-server
dhcp-option=br1,option:dns-server,149.112.121.20,149.112.122.20
dhcp-option=br1,option6:dns-server
```

Which will send our guests to CIRA's service directly, bypassing the Pi-hole.

Note that once you set these settings, you'll need to renew the DHCP lease on any
devices in your network in order to pick these changes up (easiest way is to disable
and enable your wi-fi).

On my network, I have machines inside the network with domain names that I want to be able to look up, and those domain names are assigned by my router, so I'm going to go to the Pi-hole admin interface under "Settings", go to the "DNS" tab, and scroll down to enable "Conditional Forwarding".  This basically sets it up so when I want to lookup a ".local" address, I check the DNS server on my router, and for anything else, I go to the `cloudflared` instance we set up earlier.  Update the settings below if you have a different router:

* Local Network in CIDR notation: 192.168.0.0/24
* IP address of your DHCP server (router): 192.168.0.1
* Local domain name (optional): local

## Some Handy Pi-Hole Commands

```sh
# Reset the admin password
pihole -a -p

# Clear the DNS cache
pihole restartdns

# Upgrade Pihole to the latest version
pihole -up

# Show debugging information
pihole -d
```
